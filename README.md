# SRM Respondent Home UI

User Interface for respondents to access ONS Survey Data Collection questionnaires and services

## Installation/build

To install all dependencies and download the templates run:

```shell
make install
```

To build the docker image and run the tests:

```shell
make build
```

## Running

Once that's done, you can run the make command to run it in your terminal:

```shell
make run
```

or to run it in Pycharm, use the run template that's specified and it should work as expected.

## Translations

The site uses PyBabel for translations.

Text to translate is marked up in `.html` and `.py` templates and files with the [gettext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettext) mechanism. Then a `messages.pot` file is build via Pybabel, which collates all the text to translate. Based on the content of the `.pot` file translation files `messages.po` are created for all specified language codes. Finally, the `.po` files are compiled into `.mo` files, which are then used on the page.

1. Extract text to translation

To build/re-build the translation messages.pot use:

```
pipenv run pybabel extract -F babel.cfg -o rh_ui/translations/messages.pot .
```

2. Create new language file
> [!CAUTION]
> Follow this step only when you want to add translation for a new language. Running it for an existing language code will overwrite the existing translations.

To create a new language messages file, run the following, changing the 2 character language code at the end to the
required language code. Only generate a individual language file once.

```
pipenv run pybabel init -i rh_ui/translations/messages.pot -d rh_ui/translations -l cy
```

3. Update translation files

Once created, you can update the existing language messages.po files to include changes in the messages.pot by running
the following. This will update ALL language files.

```
pipenv run pybabel update -i rh_ui/translations/messages.pot -d rh_ui/translations
```

4. Complile the translations

> [!NOTE]
> Double check your translation files (messages.po) for the `#, fuzzy` comment. This indicates that the tranlsation isn't an exact match and won't be rendered on the page. Double check the translations and remove any incorrectly matched lines, then remove the `fuzzy` comment.

To compile updates to the messages.po files into messages.mo (the file actually used by the site) use:
```
pipenv run pybabel compile -d rh_ui/translations
```
## Venom Tests

We have a suite of [Venom tests](https://github.com/ovh/venom) for testing the OWASP header recommendations. These tests
are copied from the [OWASP Secure Headers Project](https://github.com/oshp/oshp-validator).

See [./tests/venom_tests.yml](./tests/venom_tests.yml).

These tests are designed to be run against a public HTTPS endpoint in a prod-like environment, since some of the headers
they check must not be present on HTTP responses e.g.
the [HSTS header](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6797#section-6.1). Hence, these tests cannot all pass when run
against a local HTTP only instance. However, it may be useful for development to still run them locally.

### Running Venom locally

* First, use our [docker dev](https://github.com/ONSdigital/ssdc-rm-docker-dev) to run our local development
  environment to test against.

* Now create a local copy of the venom test suite with the correct URL substituted in:

  ```shell
  sed -e "s|<VENOM_TARGET_URL>|http://host.docker.internal:9092/en/start|" ./tests/venom_tests.yml > tmp_venom_local.yml
  ```

  It may be helpful to now open the created `tmp_venom_local.yml` file in an editor and comment out the
  `Strict-Transport-Security` test case which is bound to fail locally.

* Now run the tests against the docker dev RH UI using the official OVH Venom docker image (
  See https://github.com/ovh/venom?tab=readme-ov-file#docker-image for more details on running venom and docs on
  configuration).

  ```shell
  mkdir -p tmp_venom_results
  docker run --network="ssdcrmdockerdev_default" \
    --mount type=bind,source=$(pwd)/tmp_venom_local.yml,target=/workdir/tests/tests.yml \
    --mount type=bind,source=$(pwd)/tmp_venom_results,target=/workdir/results \
    ovhcom/venom:latest 
  ```

* The test results should be shown in your terminal, and details logs written in the `tmp_venom_results` folder.
